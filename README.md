# Task 02: Model Training Fundamentals with Wine Quality Dataset
## Overview
Implementation of regression models on the Wine Quality dataset (UCI ML Repository) as per Task 02 requirements.

## Setup
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Download dataset: `winequality-white.csv` from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality
3. Run `model_training.ipynb` to execute the pipeline and generate visualizations.
4. Compile `task_02_report.tex` using `latexmk -pdf task_02_report.tex` to generate the PDF report.

## Contents
- `model_training.ipynb`: Full pipeline with preprocessing, model training, and visualizations.
- `*.png`: Learning curves and coefficient plots.
- `model_comparison.csv`: Model performance metrics.
- `task_02_report.pdf`: Technical report with exercise solutions and analysis.
